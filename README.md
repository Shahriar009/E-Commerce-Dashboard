**Dashboard Overview**

##Dashboard Name: Client Analysis Dashboard ##
The Client Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive data visualization tool designed to provide insights into customer behavior, product performance, regional trends, and key metrics for a 
retail store. The dashboard integrates data from multiple CSV files, utilizes data modeling techniques, and employs various DAX functions and formulas to extract meaningful insights.

**Data Collection and Preparation Data Source:**

The project involves collecting data from various CSV files containing customer details, product details, regional information, brand details, and product returns.

**Data Integration:** 

A new CSV file named "fact table" was created, which consolidates data from all the different datasets. Each table was loaded into Excel using the "Save and Load" 
option to establish connections.

**Data Modeling:**

Data from different tables was connected through relationships using Excel's data modeling feature. This allowed for seamless data interaction and manipulation across tables.
